1.10
  - Change DISTINCT to DISTINCT ON to accommodate JSON columns, which don't
    currently have an equality operator (causing unqualified DISTINCT on tables
    with json columns to fail).

  - Set STDOUT character encoding
  - Add protype for notice function
  - Silence "use of uninitialized value" warning
  - Add verbose messages for client and server encodings

  - Added --help / --h / --usage / --? options to output the "help" using
    pod2usage. (Bricklen Anderson)

  - Added "UNLOGGED" to the "_pg_sample" table creation commands to reduce
    the overhead of creating the tables. Could also add in a "TEMPORARY"
    option to further reduce the impact on the server. (Bricklen Anderson)
